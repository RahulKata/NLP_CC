Language models and LEXICONS:

PGM
> Rich frameworks for encoding probability distributions over complex domains.
> Related to Neural network but not same

Nodes
> Random variables or features

Edges
>aka Inter-Nodal Dependencies

P - nature of the problem is probabilistic because of uncertainity
G - visualizes better
M - alogirthms represented using mathematical equations

Joint porbability distribution -- The joint probability of two or more random variables
Conditional porbability distribution -- probability of an event given the occurrence of another event.
Marginal porbability distribution -- probability of an event for one random variable, irrespective of the outcome of another random variable.

clique
> a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent

Posterior probability
> the statistical probability that a hypothesis is true calculated in the light of relevant observations
